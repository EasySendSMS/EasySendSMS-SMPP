This document provides a reference for all features available to you via the SMPP interface for sending SMS. SMPP is considered the industry standard for sending SMS to Network providers and is our native protocol. The Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) is a protocol used by the telecommunications industry for exchanging SMS messages between Short Message Service Centers (SMSC) and/or External Short Messaging Entities (ESME).

The protocol is a level-7 TCP/IP protocol, which allows fast delivery of SMS messages. The most commonly used versions of SMPP are v3.3, the most widely supported standard, and v3.4, which adds transceiver support (single connections that can send and receive messages). Data exchange may be synchronous, where each peer must wait for a response for each PDU being sent, and asynchronous, where multiple requests can be issued in one go and acknowledged in a skew order by the other peer.
